 here they can get a effect with our knowledge like math or physical some students want a not only doing

opportunity for younger and  they can new champion with the academy secondly most parents wants son or douther be
famous sportsman like Jalolidin Masharipov,Hasanboy To`smatov,temurbek or something if we came to the academy
we will have a lot of apportunities for suvimmig,running,boxing,football valeyboll basketbol however in
this days most students don’t like it because due to youtuber or blogers some students didn’t like it as
well as they are can only seeing success in the sport but they can not see hard working or improve skills and
 only discipline for to be a champion eventhough some young sportsmens wonna be milliarder in a so young
they can not anything for our future life therefore most youngers face to difficult situations that way this
 academy has already found solution a problem this academy have luxury atmosphere and Everything you need is
available as well as new and famous teacher and professors for teaching sport in the future plan of the academy
they can improve other skills moreover they are going to built a new dormitories and large gyms,
as well as a fitness club nowadays this academy have 10 000 students and 200 teachers 47 professors
therefore this academy one of the famous academy in the my country that so.

Describe a time  when you received money on your birthday?
If I had to speak about the when I received money on my birthday well you know my birthday was so fasting because
I have exam day and I had already prepared therefore I must to spend a day so fast as well as my friends wasn’t
coming my house for celebrate my birthday at these time my age 13 years old moreover only my mom and grandmother hoped
my birthday after grandmother said me Abdulla if you have chance you should come the my house and I would celebrate as
 well as you may go the exam and I was saying I  had had already exam day  therefore I most go to the exam at these
time grandmother found a new solution for my birthday and said me if you haven’t chance to celebrate the birthday I will
 give you enough money foy your study or after this day you may spend a this money for walking or celebrate your birthday
in luxury restaurants I can believe it because I have never get a lot of money for celebrate my birthday or spend for
anything for example if I had a lot of money per day I would pen the new little business but I have not chance and after
 the exam day my dad said me if you passed the your exam I will buy something what do you want or I will give you
1 million to spend and these time I have a lot of money for buy anything maybe total 4 millions money given for my birthday
 and I have already planed for buy something like new phone or bike but I lost my money therefore I hadn’t both bought
well this situation is other story but The most money I've ever earned   in my birthday  

<3>
Describe an important thing you learned(not at school or collage)
I wonna tell you about the important thing I learned this thing only can be computer security and new technology when
 I was young I used to like a create something  or  I want block someone when they always hate me because I was l
earning a new things for new technology and computer security for example if I have chance for doing something
I can  do it that’s way in the past I prefer that face to difficult situations some people think that
I have never do it but They cant know I was studying computer security system and these time
I had had Already new skills with security due to know security system I could  anything  when people hated me
 therefore sometimes my friends want a see this job moreover Because of some of my teachers' anger towards
me due to some of the things I was able to do, I did a lot of things to intimidate them by carrying out some
 acts of aggression you know? Haw I learned it one day my best friend came to my country because my close friend
lived in America therefore came here as well as said me if you wont improve our computer security system
I would teach you and I need  one things because if you going to learning you must only humility one rule
this rule is you must have never give up to improve our skills and that’s enough for learning as well as
we was starting I learned so fast this is a important in my life not only in my life but also in my future
 life but nowadays I don’t use the opportunity because this  work is becoming very famous between teenagers
therefore Many countries have taken these matters seriously, as they are very concerned about the security of the
 state and the population, but not everyone can do this, especially individuals who do not belong to the state. 

Part 3 
<1>
What can people do help themselves remember information for their every day needs?
Well I’m wonna tell you about what people do help themselves remember information for their every day needs?
Initially people should create a new rule for agenda secondly nowadays some people don’t think that problem
therefore most people face to with some problems There is only one solution to this if people focus on the only
our work they will not face to other problems with job 

<2>
How people improve their memory?
Well in my thinking way most people try to improve their memory because in this  days some people think that save
the some memory is becoming so difficult for a teenagers due to this problem most people lose their memory
 I know the reason why people are losing our memory for example most people spend time for computers game or
 mobile game and nowadays people should read a some book or hard work ourself only then will  achieve the result.

<3>
 Why do sometimes people forget things they don’t want to do?
Well it can to my mind when people were seeing the who like something they were forgetting their don’t
want to do because it can give effect peoples mood as well as they want a remember their don’t want
to do therefore sometimes people forget things they don’t want to do.
